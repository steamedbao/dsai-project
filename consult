Can focus on country
Can focus on a few factors
  Must link the few factors together
  
we can either focus on one country
or we can use a few factors, but the few factors we need to link them together
can include external data to support our reasoninga
i thk focus on one country actl not bad
cos we can just do on all the factors for the one country
if we compare a few diff countries oso can.. 
then bring in economies of these countries and historic events that affected the countrys performance
